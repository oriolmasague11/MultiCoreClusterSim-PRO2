# MultiCoreClusterSim-PRO2
A simulator of a multiprocessor cluster organized as a binary tree. Each processor manages its own memory and active processes, while an external waiting area handles queued processes with priority ordering. The system supports process insertion, removal, scheduling, memory allocation, time advancement, and cluster reconfiguration.
